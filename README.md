# MLB Simulator

An end-to-end Python project to simulate MLB matchups.  
It fetches/cleans data, builds pitcher and batter profiles, and runs probability models (Poisson + Monte Carlo-style) to generate game-day insights such as strikeout distributions and batting prop probabilities.

## Features

### ðŸ—„Data Layer & ETL
- Loads input data from `data/` (CSV-based) with **sample datasets included** for instant demo.
- ETL stubs provided for future integration with:
  - **Statcast** (batted-ball profiles, pitcher whiff rates)  
  - **FanGraphs** (advanced splits & projections)  
  - **MLB.com** (lineups, injuries, team depth charts)  
- Supports player lookup tables, lineup construction, and roster management.

###  Statistical Modeling
- **Pitcher Projections:** Poisson-based KO distributions from K/9 and IP/start.  
- **Batter Projections:** Per-PA event probabilities (1B, 2B, 3B, HR, BB).  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation (roadmap):** scalable engine to simulate thousands of games.  
- **Negative Binomial Extensions (roadmap):** improved variance handling for Ks and hits.  

###  Contextual Adjustments
- Lineup-spot based expected plate appearances (1â€“9).  
- Ready to incorporate **park factors, pace adjustments, and umpire tendencies**.  
- Extensible to account for **bullpen fatigue, travel effects, and injuries**.  

###  Outputs & Reporting
- **Starter KO probability tables** (e.g., P(Kâ‰¥4), P(Kâ‰¥6), 90% CIs).  
- **Batter prop tables** with P(Hitsâ‰¥1), P(HRâ‰¥1), P(2Bâ‰¥1), P(3Bâ‰¥1).  
- Outputs printed to console in **clean tabular format**.  
- Future: export results to **CSV/Excel** for integration with dashboards or betting models.  

###  Extensible Design
- Modular architecture:  
  - `fetch.py` â†’ handles ETL & data loading  
  - `precompute.py` â†’ builds player profiles & probability models  
  - `gameday_sim.py` â†’ orchestrates simulations & reporting  
- Easy to extend with:
  - **Regression models (scikit-learn, XGBoost)**  
  - **Bayesian updates** with live data  
  - **Full-game simulation with Markov chain or run expectancy matrices**
